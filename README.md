# GameBoy Bezels for RP5

These are some bezels for Gameboy DMG, Pocket, Color, and Advanced I've make for RetroArch and tested on the Retroid Pocket 5. These are based on the style of [mugwomp93's overlays for 640x480 devices](https://github.com/mugwomp93/muOS_Customization). Russ from [RetroGameCorps has put together an excellent guide](https://retrogamecorps.com/2024/09/01/guide-shaders-and-overlays-on-retro-handhelds/) on how to use shaders and overlays on RetroArch to get overlays like these working.
