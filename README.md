# Overlays

These are some really simple overlays I've made for RetroArch. These include a variety of overlays for consoles and handhelds. I've used these on the Retroid Pocket 5 and AYN Thor, but they should be fine on any 1080p display. I have also made 720p versions that I use on the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro, but should work on any 720p display. These are based on the style of [mugwomp93's overlays for 640x480 devices](https://github.com/mugwomp93/muOS_Customization). Russ from [RetroGameCorps has put together an excellent guide](https://retrogamecorps.com/2024/09/01/guide-shaders-and-overlays-on-retro-handhelds/) on how to use shaders and overlays on RetroArch to get overlays like these working.

Notes:
* For the GBA overlays use Integer Scale by opening Retroarch in game and going to Settings > Video > Scaling, and turning ON the Integer Scale option. You will also need to adjust the Viewport Anchor Bias Y to 0.05 value.
* Depending on which shaders you use you might need to edit the Shader Parameters to make the overlays work. Ex. I personally like the Koko Aio shaders, but I turn off the Bezel and Ambient Lights on the Shader Parameters, to make the shader be compatible with overlays.
* There are more overlays than the ones shown here. The zip files contain a black and dark gray variant of each overlay, as well as alternative designs for some of them.
